      "I'm a systems thinker who operates in both design and code. This dual perspective lets me bridge what users need with what's possible to build. I speak both designers' and developers' languages, which makes collaboration flow naturally. I'm naturally curious, maybe annoyingly so - constantly asking questions that uncover better solutions.",
      "Let's build something meaningful together. If you're looking for a designer who thinks strategically, codes functionally, and questions relentlessly, I'd love to collaborate. Reach out - let's talk about how we can create products that actually work for people."

    "description": "Design principles aren't aspirational statements. They're decision-making frameworks. The best ones create productive tension, forcing you to choose what matters most when trade-offs become inevitable. They acknowledge constraints rather than ignore them. And they're only valuable if they actually shape how you work.",
