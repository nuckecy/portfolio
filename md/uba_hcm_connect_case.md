# Transforming HR Operations for 20,000+ Employees Across Africa

A comprehensive 12-module enterprise platform that reduced manual HR processes by 91%, eliminated $960,000 in annual licensing costs, and advanced organizational design maturity from Level 1 to Level 3.

## Project Summary

Led the complete design transformation of UBA's HR operations through a comprehensive 12-module enterprise platform, replacing expensive third-party solutions while serving 20,000+ employees across 20 African countries and international hubs in London, Paris, and New York. Working with a 23-person cross-functional squad in a low UX maturity environment, I implemented a "seeing is believing" strategy using tangible prototypes to build stakeholder confidence while conducting comprehensive user research across diverse cultural contexts.

## Approach

### "Seeing is Believing" Strategy

Given the low UX maturity (Level 1) of the organization, I implemented a strategic approach using tangible prototypes to build stakeholder confidence while conducting comprehensive user research.

**Research Methods:**
- **23 stakeholder interviews** across C-suite, HR managers, and regional leads
- **47 employee contextual inquiries** across Nigeria, Kenya, and UK offices
- **12 process mapping workshops** documenting current-state HR workflows
- **Cultural sensitivity research** understanding work practices across 20 countries
- **Competitive analysis** benchmarking against Workday, BambooHR, and regional solutions

### Strategic Design Principles

**Cultural Adaptability:** Flexible components accommodating regional variations in HR practices and compliance requirements

**Progressive Disclosure:** Layered complexity based on user sophistication, supporting varying technical literacy levels

**Mobile-First Design:** Primary experience optimized for mobile devices (67% of employees primarily accessed systems via mobile)

**Inclusive Accessibility:** Design for varying technical literacy and infrastructure capabilities

**Modular Architecture:** Scalable system supporting future expansion across 12 distinct modules

### 12-Module System Architecture

Created an integrated platform replacing fragmented tools:

1. **Core Human Resource:** Employee profiles, organizational charts
2. **Organization Structure:** Department management, hierarchy visualization
3. **ManPower & Recruitment:** Job posting, candidate tracking, interview scheduling
4. **Talent Center:** Skills assessment, career development pathways
5. **Benefit Management:** Insurance, compensation, employee perks
6. **Leave Management:** PTO requests, approval workflows, calendar integration
7. **Promotion Management:** Performance reviews, career advancement tracking
8. **Potential Assessment:** Skills evaluation, development planning
9. **Confirmation Management:** Probation tracking, performance milestones
10. **HR Helpdesk:** Internal support tickets, knowledge base
11. **Sanctions & Rewards:** Performance management, recognition programs
12. **Exit Management:** Offboarding workflows, knowledge transfer

- **Knowledge transfer** with design documentation used for subsequent digital initiatives
- **Cultural change** embedding user-centered thinking in organizational decision-making

### Qualitative Impact

*"The HCM Connect transformation fundamentally changed how our employees interact with HR services. What used to take days now happens in minutes, and our people can focus on strategic work rather than administrative tasks."*  
— HR Director, UBA

*"The design system approach meant we could scale consistently across all our African operations while respecting local needs. It's become the blueprint for all our digital initiatives."*  
— Head of Technology, UBA

## Reflection

**The Biggest Learning:** Cultural design importance cannot be overstated. Local context was crucial for enterprise design success in a global organization. What works in London doesn't necessarily work in Lagos or Nairobi. Building flexibility into the design system from the beginning allowed us to scale while respecting regional differences.

**What I Would Do Differently:** Start with smaller, focused modules rather than tackling all 12 simultaneously. While we succeeded, a phased approach with 3-4 core modules first would have allowed faster learning cycles and earlier value delivery, reducing risk in the low-maturity environment.

**Stakeholder Journey Design Insight:** In enterprise contexts with low design maturity, designing for decision-makers is as important as designing for end-users. The "seeing is believing" approach with tangible prototypes was essential for building confidence and securing buy-in at every stage.

**Remote Collaboration Success:** Effective virtual design collaboration during COVID-19 proved that distributed teams can match in-person outcomes with the right processes. Structured async feedback workflows, regular virtual design sprints, and clear documentation were key enablers.

**Long-Term Platform Impact:** The HCM Connect design system and principles became the foundation for UBA's broader digital transformation, influencing subsequent projects worth €50M+ in total investment and establishing design as a strategic function within the organization.
