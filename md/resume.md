## Professional Journey
I started my career as a frontend engineer, and that technical foundation has been instrumental to my journey as a designer. It gave me a unique perspective, bridging the gap between what's technically feasible and what users truly need. With over 14 years of experience, I've had the opportunity to not just design products but to strategically lead and shape design organizations across diverse sectors, including e-commerce and banking. I am passionate about taking on complex business challenges and turning them into research-backed, user-validated experiences that deliver real, measurable business growth. Every design decision I make is anchored in rigorous user research, which ensures our solutions genuinely address user needs while achieving critical business objectives.

## Design Philosophy
I believe great design is a strategic business function, not just an aesthetic one. This approach extends to my leadership style: I focus on building resilient, data-informed design teams that serve as strategic partners to the business, rather than just service providers. I'm passionate about mentoring and empowering my team to grow their skills and careers, creating a culture of excellence and innovation that raises the bar for everyone.

## EXPERIENCE: DETAILS & PROJECTS

### ZALANDO SE | Berlin, Germany
#### Senior Product Designer, Customer Care Pillar | Nov 2021 - Present
I lead the end-to-end design for the customer care division at Europe's largest fashion e-commerce platform. My focus has been on initiatives that improve customer support experiences while making our operations more efficient.

**Key Contributions:**

##### Customer Care: Contextual Self-Help
**Problem:** We were dealing with approximately 20 million customer inquiries every year. It was a huge problem, and we needed a better way to solve customer challenges without them having to make multiple contacts.
**Solution Design:** I designed a data-driven contextual support system that gave customers personalized self-service options, often solving their problem in just one go. My technical background as a UX engineer allowed me to collaborate with engineering on a smart content delivery API that cut down page load time by 35%.
**Impact:**
* Reduced support ticket volume by 42%.
* Decreased resolution time from over 24 hours to under 3 hours.
* Improved customer satisfaction scores by 28%.
* Generated €3.4M in annual operational savings.

##### Guided Conversational Chatbot
**Problem:** Our old chatbot was pretty rigid, which meant a 78% abandonment rate and a 43% escalation to human agents. Customers felt trapped in loops and kept having to repeat themselves, which was not a good look for the brand and was damaging our reputation.
**Solution Design:** By analyzing over 100 customer histories and use cases, I discovered useful insights and designed a new conversational architecture. This new system used natural language understanding with high accuracy and dynamic conversation paths that could adapt to a customer's emotional cues. We also included multi-modal confirmation states (visual, textual, and progress indicators) to keep customers confident throughout the interaction.
**Impact:**
* Increased the automation rate by 34%, beating our target by 9%.
* Reduced the average handling time by 47%.
* Improved the first-contact resolution rate by 23%.

##### Accessibility Transformation Initiative
**Problem:** After a comprehensive accessibility audit, we discovered that 78% of our customer-facing interfaces and touchpoints had major WCAG compliance issues. This was a big deal because it meant we were effectively excluding about 15% of our potential customers and facing significant legal and reputational risks in our key European markets.
**Solution Design:** As a key part of a company-wide initiative, I drove the WCAG compliance solution for the Customer Care touchpoints. I optimized and tested all the designs to achieve AA and AAA accessibility compliance for web forms, FAQs, and contextual self-help tools to meet the full European Accessibility Act compliance by June 2025, which included implementing dark mode and dynamic text capabilities.
**Impact:**
* We achieved WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across 94% of customer interfaces.
* This helped expand our potential market by approximately 2.3 million new customers.
* It also reduced our legal compliance risk by 65%.

### UNITED BANK OF AFRICA
#### Design Lead, Lagos, Nigeria | Jan 2020 - Nov 2021
I directed the design strategy for a pan-African financial institution, leading and managing design and engineering teams to deliver digital transformation initiatives that redefined banking experiences for over 20 million customers across 20 countries.

**Key Contributions:**
* **Design System Implementation:** We established the bank's first comprehensive design system, which had over 120 reusable components, increasing our design-to-development velocity by 65%. My hands-on skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were crucial in making sure these components were technically sound and easy for engineers to use.
* **UX Maturity Enhancement:** I helped elevate the organizational UX maturity through structured stakeholder engagement and research-driven practices, which improved cross-functional collaboration by 60%.
* **Mentoring & Team Leadership:** I was responsible for a team of four designers (a content designer and three product designers) and mentored them to develop their skills and careers. I also mentored a product design intern, who later joined the team full-time.
* **Cross-Functional Excellence:** I led a team of over 20 designers, engineers, product managers, and analysts through the complete product lifecycle.

**Strategic Achievements:**

##### HCM CONNECT
**Problem:** UBA's fragmented HR infrastructure was a huge problem, creating significant business vulnerabilities across 20 countries. Disconnected data systems caused payroll errors, wasted over 30 weekly hours on manual reconciliation, and created documentation gaps that exposed the bank to a potential $1.2M in license fees and operational costs annually.
**Solution Design:** I led the architecture and design of a centralized employee management ecosystem that consolidated seven different systems into a single source of truth. My technical skills were essential in developing an intelligent data integration layer that allowed real-time synchronization between our previously siloed databases and implemented automated validation checks that kept our data integrity at 99.7%.
**Impact:**
* We eliminated $80,000 in monthly license fees.
* We improved the HR team's productivity by 43%.
* We reduced compliance reporting time from 3 days to 4 hours.
* This contributed to an 8% annual profitability improvement.

### STERLING BANK PLC
#### Product Designer & UX Engineer, Lagos, Nigeria | Jan 2014 - Jan 2020
Over eight years, I evolved my career from frontend engineer to senior product designer, where I was a key part of the digital transformation initiatives that redefined the bank's customer experience strategy and technical approach.

**Key Contributions:**
* **Product Design & Strategy:** I collaborated with cross-functional teams, including engineers, product managers, and customer success teams, to develop comprehensive product roadmaps. I conducted thorough requirements analysis, user research, and usability testing to make sure our design decisions were data-driven.
* **UX Engineering Support:** I leveraged my front-end development skills to create production-ready UI components in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, directly supporting the design team. I worked closely with engineers during the design hand-off process, providing technical support and ensuring designs were feasible and implemented correctly.

**Strategic Achievements:**

##### Specta (Digital Lending Platform)
**Problem:** Nigeria's lending system was extremely inefficient, taking 14-21 days for approval and requiring extensive paperwork and multiple branch visits. This resulted in a 68% application abandonment rate and limited market reach.
**Solution Design:** I helped architect Nigeria's first fully digital lending platform, which used biometric identity verification and real-time credit scoring to enable 5-minute loan approvals. The research-validated interface used progressive disclosure to boost completion rates by 82% above industry standards.
**Impact:**
* We facilitated N20 billion ($55 million) in loan disbursements.
* We achieved an exceptional 0.1% non-performing loan rate.
* We improved operational efficiency by 80%.
* We expanded our customer acquisition by 230%.

##### Doubble (Investment Platform)
**Problem:** We were facing a 92% investment exclusion rate in Nigeria because of high minimum requirements ($5,000+) and complex onboarding processes. Most customers just didn't have the financial literacy to participate.
**Solution Design:** I designed a market-disrupting micro-investment platform that allowed contributions as low as $10. The platform had a behavior-based user journey with embedded financial education that increased investor confidence by 58%.
**Impact:**
* We increased first-time investors by 134%.
* We improved the conversion rate from registration to investment by 46%.
* We enhanced customer lifetime value by 28%.

##### Fraud Analytics & Management Solution
**Problem:** Our old fraud detection systems were reactive, leading to significant financial losses and customer friction during transactions.
**Solution Design:** I designed a predictive fraud monitoring system that required minimal customer intervention. It was based on comprehensive user interviews and behavioral analysis and implemented an intelligent alert system with contextual verification workflows.
**Business Impact:**
* We reduced fraud incidents by 34%.
* We decreased false positives by 47%.
* We improved the customer transaction completion rate by 23%.
* We saved approximately N155 million in potential fraud losses.
