With over 14 years of experience, I've had the opportunity to not just design products but to strategically lead and shape design organizations across diverse sectors, including e-commerce and banking. I am passionate about taking on complex business challenges and turning them into research-backed, user-validated experiences that deliver real, measurable business growth. Every design decision I make is anchored in rigorous user research, which ensures our solutions genuinely address user needs while achieving critical business objectives.",

          "solution": "By analyzing over 100 customer histories and use cases, I discovered useful insights and designed a new conversational architecture. This new system used natural language understanding with high accuracy and dynamic conversation paths that could adapt to a customer's emotional cues.
